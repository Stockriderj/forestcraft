        <h1 class="display-1">Forest Update</h1>
        <p class="lead">The ForestCraft Forest Update was a large package of fun! It was a huge <a
                href="update-chains.html">update chain</a> spanning
            from v0.1.5 to v0.1.5.15.</p>

        <!-- New Features -->
        <div>
            <h2 class="display-3">New Features</h2>

            <!-- World Generation -->
            <div>
                <h3 class="display-4">World Generation</h3>
                <p class="lead">The Forest Update was a miracle for the trees! It allowed their generation to be a more
                    pleasant
                    experience.</p>
                <p>v0.1.5.5 was the version that trees could generate a lot better than before. For reference, take the
                    following images as examples.</p>

            <!-- Apples -->
            <div>
                <h3 class="display-4">Apples</h3>
                <p class="lead">The only food at the time, the apple went through a few changes.</p>
                <p>The apple received the following updates:</p>
                <ul class="list-group mb-5 w-75">
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.7 - This update made apples fall from trees. Before this update,
                        apples just came out of the middle of nowhere.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.15 - Multiple apples can now drop from trees, enabling people to
                        farm apples.</li>
                    <img src="images/apple-farming.png" alt="An image of a player farming apples"
                        class="img-fluid rounded-bottom">
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Trees -->
            <div>
                <h3 class="display-4">Trees and Wood</h3>
                <p class="lead">Trees! Trees were the center of attention in this update, so obviously they went through
                    a lot of changes.</p>
                <p>The trees received the following updates:</p>
                <ul class="list-group mb-5 w-75">
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.10 - With this update was the introduction of wood. Although the
                        ability to punch trees has existed since v0.1.1.10, wood hasn't existed before this update.
                        However, wood was not given any purpose.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.11 - Right after the introduction of wood, a new feature was
                        introduced. Hint: It's something to do with wood. In this version, gathering wood can hurt you,
                        because I figured, hey, don't people get injured when chopping wood?</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.16 - After a few fails and debug sessions, you are finally
                        allowed to climb trees. What's a forest update without climbing trees?</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.18 - Since now you can climb trees, you'll be poking your head in
                        the leaves. So I made the leaves slow your fall - and ascent.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">v0.1.5.12 - It can be frustrating to gather 100 pieces of your useless
                        wood and then die. So, in this version, your wood will drop upon death. To collect your wood,
                        you walk over, and once you touch it, you will get your wood back. Beware, though, because it
                        will desapawn after 30 seconds!</li>
