                <p>v0.6 was the version where the Busher was added. It was inspired by <a

                    Monster. It is a bush with apples as eyes and an angry expression, and killing it gives you 9 wood

                    you closed the inventory immediately yeeted itself out of the playground. Why? Because v0.5.17
                    had
                    this flyswatter that was specially made to destroy that bug.</p>
